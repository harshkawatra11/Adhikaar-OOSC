// The question legality linter. Every rule here is plain TypeScript
// evaluated against the drafted question text, and every finding cites a
// specific corpus chunk. Nothing in this file calls a model. A rewrite
// suggestion may later be phrased by an LLM, but whether a rule fires,
// and which section it fires under, is decided here and only here. See
// getCorpusChunk in rti-act.ts for the text a citation resolves to; a
// ruleId that names a citationId not present in that corpus is a bug,
// and the test suite in rules.test.ts asserts against exactly that.
